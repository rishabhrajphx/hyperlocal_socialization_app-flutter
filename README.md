# hyper_local_socialization_app



This is one of my winter projects where I will build a mixed-platform app that allows for hyper local event organization. 
-> Focused on providing ability to organize and promote events in a local environment. 
-> Provide organizers recommendations for businesses that they can then use to host their events. 
-> If the project goes public, have local businesses signup and we take a cut of the money they would make from the bookings on my app.
